Personal project to create a bash script which can output useful information about all git repositories on a system.

Initially attempted to create this with standard shell tools (awk, sed, grep) and no external libraries or files, however limitations with the shell caused me to redevelop the project as a Perl script with an associated Ruby script for language analysis using the github-linguist library.
